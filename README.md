# BorrowingsGroupProject
Repository contains notebook with research and implemented model for borrowings in Andic languages

Linguistic borrowing is a phenomenon of the transfer of language structures (lexical, phonological, morphological, syntactic) from the donor language to the recipient language as a result of contact between multilingual communities. The donor of borrowed units can be a related and unrelated language; due to the Islamization of the Caucasus, the languages of the indigenous peoples of the Caucasus have a lot of borrowed lexicon related to religion (for example, most of the dictionaries of low-resource Andic languages we analyzed were borrowed from unrelated Arabic). In this work, a model for automatically detecting borrowings for Andic languages based on logistic regression and CountVectorizer for automatically detecting a borrowing word of a low-resource language is developed. The model is evaluated through classification quality metrics (F1-score) and word generation based on the borrowing pattern (perplexity).
